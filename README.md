GFD-Net
=========

GFD-Net is a Cytoscape app designed to visualize and analyze the functional dissimilarity of gene networks. GFD-Net can analyze a gene network based on Gene Ontology (GO) and calculate a quantitative measure of its functional dissimilarity, i.e. a quantitative value of the degree of dissimilarity between the connected genes in it.
What else 

After the analysis, users can visualize the information retrieved from GO.

- For each gene the user can see its associated GO terms and its function (specified by a GO term) chosen as the most cohesive function in the set.
- For each edge the user can see the genes at its ends, the function chosen as the most cohesive function in the set for each one and the dissimilarity between them.
